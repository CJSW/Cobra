Our editor is doing a liquor run, so we can't check with him right now) page, and has sent us some 80's electronica. We're pretty impressed by this stuff - Calgary's always been a rawk town, so this really is a part of the underground.

This tape is a collaboration of sorts between Reynolds (brokenpaws) and Mikel Weicker (Weep O Mine Eyes). Reynolds tells us that the tape was recorded in both of their home studios they got to use two tracks each on a 4-track machine, combining them together to form one track. It's kid of hard to fathom how this would have come together over 20 years ago.

Reynolds has pointed us to some reviews of the tape from back in the day, and also some of his and Weicker's more recent (relatively) involvement in the local electronica scene.

Anyways, we've ignored the dire warning on this tape, and hope you enjoy this little slice of coffeeshop folk.

We're hoping the title of the first track is Hard Ride, and not Hand Ride, as one of our archivists insists.

Eternal Now started off as a Calgary-based band, but at some point at least three of the group moved on to Toronto. We're wondering if there's any link between these folks' move and the similar move that Allen Baekeland made with Lost and Profound. There's a few points of connection between the players in both bands (CJSW/VOX, The Now Feeling, probably countless others that we're not aware of...). Anyways, since these guys started off here in Calgary, we're calling this a legit Calgary release.

We're not sure exactly who all of the folks in this little pop band are - with the exception of Corey Worsnop, who went on to play in the superbly named Toledo Speedway. This is jangly, early-90's alt-pop.

This is great roots rock - fun, catchy and, uh, twangy.

The Alien Rebels have a myspace that appears to repurpose content from a long-deceased website. It reminds us of the pedigree of this band - since this tape, the band has drawn on the talents of a pretty impressive roster. Plus, members have also done turns in Jr Gone Wild and... other bands. Plus, they've been on the CBC a pile.

Did we mention the twanginess?

We usually don't like to divulge our sources here at the CCPS, but we'll share one secret with you: we keep the Bell/Simm Play compilation  close by our fingertips at all times, as it's proved to be a fantastic source for sorting out some of the players in mid-90s indie rock. One of the pieces it's helping us sort out today is the mystery that is this extremely brief tape.

We've been a bit lax with posting over the past few days, mostly because of the usual seasonal eating/drinking cycles we've fallen into here at the CCPS. So we're pleased to present this for your consideration, the second Sky Suspended tape.

Sky Suspended prompt us to ask several questions. First, how did Aaron Booth turn from this (we'll call it Disintegration-era Cure) to the sensitive singer-songwriter type? Second, how did Aaron Smelski go from bass with this to shoegaze guitar with Hot Little Rocket and heat-ray? And finally, what is up with all the Teddy Boys on the inner sleeve?

The first few songs on here fit the same style as the tape we featured yesterday our Musical Analogue Expert wants to compare these guys to Hunters and Collectors without the horn section. We're still trying to figure out how we ended up with a position called a Musical Analogue Expert. We think he's referring to the anthemic, big music sound they put out. Anyhow, we found a bio of frontman Bruce Callow that indicates he split town and headed to Costa Rica, where he's been since. After the first tape, the style of this changes radically - ending in pretty uninteresting blues rock (to us - but then, we've never like the blues). We were overly-quick in returning the tapes we borrowed from CJSW back to Myke Atkinson we neglected to make any notes of who the members were for the final two tapes.

The same bio of Bruce Callow indicates that the New Internationalists reunited sometime after 2003, and put out a CD.

But, again, we don't really care about CDs here.

We posted the first TFD tape quite a while back. For this outing, they're sporting a new bassist and drummer (Corey Martens went onto infamy with Helvis). The first side of this tape are studio tracks, but it's the second side, recorded live at the Night Gallery, that gives a better taste of hee-haw punk rawk flavour of these guys, as well as showing off Ian Doig's penchant for telling very strange historical tales.

As an aside, this tape is another we've borrowed from the CJSW archives. We'll be back at CJSW tomorrow, on our pal Adam Kamis' show, the Failed Pilot (12-2 pm MST), playing some of our favourite tapes. Which means it'll be a solid two hours of Primrods. And maybe a bit of Brass.";"Yes"

This is a nice little preview of things to come Kris' voice sounds younger, his delivery perhaps isn's as assured as it is now, but the songs are definitely coming from the same place - lots of quirky storytelling, driven by Kris' sometimes manic acoustic guitar. We're not sure of the year on this - we're guessing at 1995 (their CD came out in 1996). We're pretty sure the cover art is by Ian Doig, though. Also, our hand-delivered copy of FFWD arrived late this week.

Very lo-fi, down-tempo alt-country rock that would play well alongside Wilco, Sun 
Kil Moon or the like. Unfortunately, most of the album is down-tempo and after a few songs, it begins to sound formulaic and wears on the listener. Good album with solid songwriting, but it would have benefitted with a little diversity within their sound. ";" "
