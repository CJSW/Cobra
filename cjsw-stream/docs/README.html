These are the CJSW Stream Utilities.  
Each utility can be run with 'java -jar [utility].jar', where the utility
is one of:

<ul>
<li>Archiver: saves audio from one or more streams to a location on the 
filesystem.</li>
<li>LocationPoller: polls for listener ip addresses, resolves them to geographical
coordinates and plots them on a google map, to provide a near real time view of 
listener locations.</li>
<li>TranscoderWatcher: ensures the transcoder process is actually working, and restarts
it if not</li>
<li>MetadataSetter: updates stream metadata</li>
</ul>

These utilities can be run in standalone mode, or may be installed as a service.
To install as a service, do
<pre>
  java -jar [utility].jar --install [--param1 val1]
</pre>
To get help for the various parameters, do
<pre>
  java -jar [utility].jar --help
</pre>
